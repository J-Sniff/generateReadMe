# GenerateReadMe

This project was built to help developers spend more time on their project rather than their readME. With this application you can generate a professional readME for any of your projects.

## Key Features

This application uses node.js to ask you a list of questions that every professional readME should have then format it for you in a clear manner.
It will add in a description, table of contents, licenses, contact information, and more.
